This repository contains code associated with the following paper:

“Sequence dependence of biomolecular phase separation.” Weiner, Meir, and Wingreen. bioRxiv 2020.09.24.312330  (available online at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.24.312330v2)

The folder "condensation analysis" contains a script to calculate the condensation parameter Psi from a sequence of heterotypic motifs, specified as 1 and -1. The folder contains an example sequence file.

Simulation code for the paper is contained in the folder "multicanonical simulations." "multicanonical reweighting" contains the script to estimate P(N) at lower temperatures, which is used for iteratively tracing the binodal at lower temperatures. "critical point fitting" contains the script to determine the critical point from simulation data taken *near* the critical point.

The data used in the paper can be found in an Open Science Framework (OSF) repository: https://osf.io/47anf/. This data, along with the scripts in the folder "plotting and analysis scripts," can be used to reproduce the figures in the main text.
