This folder contains the source code for polymer Monte Carlo simulations in the Grand Canonical Ensemble, with the option of including a "preweighting" file for multicanonical sampling. All code is written in C++17.

Here is an example command to run a simulation:
"./multicanonical multicanonical_L24_b12_beta0_0.7692846091008065_beta1_0.7716181316764409_j0.05_rep0 lattice_fcc.txt polySpecs_L24_b12.txt annealing_schedule_e0.7716181316764409.txt 100 300000000 4000 0.05 preweighting_L24_b12_beta0_0.7692846091008065_beta1_0.7716181316764409.txt 6920"

This command specifies the following inputs:
1. Executable
2. Simulation name for parameter record and all data
3. Lattice specification file
4. Polymer specification file
5. Simulated annealing schedule
6. Initial polymer number
7. Monte Carlo steps
8. Write interval
9. Nonspecific interaction parameter (units of specific binding energy)
10. Preweighting file for multicanonical simulations (includes chemical potential mu)
11. Seed for RNG

The simulation will produce 2 outputs:
1) A "paramRecord" file recording all parameters.
2) a "writeRecord" in the following format:
Step beta polymer-number energy

The full (x,y,z) coordinates at each step can be recorded by setting "writeFullConfig=true;" in main_multicanonical.cpp and recompiling.

For simulations without multicanonical sampling, use a preweighting file with P(N)=constant for all N.
